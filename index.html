                My name is Fady Naguib. I was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt. After finishing highschool, I decided to
                move to
                Arizona, where I had some family
                living, in order to pursue a better future and a more luxurious career in the field of chemical
                enginerring.
                After graduating from <a href="https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/chemical-engineering-bse/">Arizona
                    Sate University</a> with a BSE of chemcial engineering in 2017, I began
                looking at the different idustries and fields that interested me. As my research went on, I realized
                that
                the
                market for software developers
                and software engineers was very hot. Now, during my engineering undergraduate days, I often was very
                amazed
                by
                sotware such as MatLAB, which made
                complex engineering calculations rather simple and less time consuming. I began liking the idea of
                developing
                solutions to complex problems using
                software, which led me to the coding bootcamp in University of Arizona.

                I'm very glad I discovered my passion early on in life and am able to pursue an immersive program that
                can
                teach me all the necessary skills and tools
                in order to be successful in the path I chose to take. In this portfolio, I plan on documenting my path
                towards
                learning web development and turning my
                passion into a successful career.
